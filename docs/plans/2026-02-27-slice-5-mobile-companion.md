## Objective

Deliver Slice 5 acceptance by making `/mobile` a low-friction control plane for long-running orchestrator projects: clear approvals, status, and report visibility with minimal interaction cost.

## Detailed Todos

- [x] Add explicit Slice 5 todo plan document and scope.
- [x] Improve mobile approvals UX to use per-confirmation options when available (instead of static generic actions only).
- [x] Ensure one-tap approval actions send deterministic approval intent text that clears pending confirmation flow reliably.
- [x] Keep alerts/reports/project status behavior intact while adding approval-option rendering.
- [x] Run frontend build validation to ensure no regressions.
- [x] Update this checklist to reflect completed Slice 5 work.

## Notes

Slice 5 in this pass focuses on interaction reliability and control-plane clarity, not visual redesign.
